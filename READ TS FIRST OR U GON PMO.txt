*DOWNLOAD LOMBOK FIRST BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE*

âœ… Step 1: Download Lombok JAR
Go to the official site:
ðŸ‘‰ https://projectlombok.org/download

Click to download the latest .jar file (e.g., lombok-1.18.30.jar).

âœ… Step 2: Add Lombok JAR to IntelliJ Project
Open IntelliJ

In the top menu, go to:

File > Project Structure (or press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)
In the Project Structure window:

On the left panel, click "Modules"

Select your module (FileCompressor or whatever it's called)

Go to the "Dependencies" tab (top center)

Click the + button (top right) â†’ Choose "JARs or directories..."

Browse and select the downloaded lombok-<version>.jar file

After adding it, set the Scope to "Provided" (or "Compile" if "Provided" isn't an option)

Click Apply, then OK

âœ… Step 3: Rebuild Your Project
Now do:

Build > Rebuild Project
This forces IntelliJ to reprocess all annotations, including Lombok-generated methods.

âœ… Step 4: (Reconfirm) Enable Annotation Processing
If you havenâ€™t already:

Go to:

File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors
Check âœ… Enable annotation processing

Apply and OK

Youre Done! Yipee!
